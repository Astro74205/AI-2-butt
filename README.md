AI-2-butt
=============

Forked port of the classic browser extension (https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) that replaces occurrences of 'the cloud' with 'my butt', now AI enhanced. 

Just like 15 years ago everyone being sick of "Cloud this, cloud that", now we're sick of AI ehanced everything. 

Install this browser plugin, and you'll see how you can automate code reviews by running it through "my butt", and how "my butt" is changing the college experience.
